# Agent Notes

- Respect the existing `.gitignore` and keep secrets out of the repo.
- Follow current CSS patterns when adding new panels or resource lists so spacing stays consistent.
- Optimize images and other assets before committing.
- Keep user-facing text in French by default; add translations only when explicitly requested.
- Use `AGENTS.md` for high-level guidance onlyâ€”avoid documenting sensitive infrastructure here.
